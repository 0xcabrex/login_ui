# Login UI Design

A Flutter project that gives basic flutter design to implement a login UI.

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates a widget to make a fully functioning login UI.\
Please integrate database or other things on your own. I hardcorded the credentials.
```
Username: username
Password: password123
```
They are case sensitive.
